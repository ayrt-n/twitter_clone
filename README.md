# Twitter Clone

## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of the Forms and Authentication section of the Ruby on Rails course.

Through this project, followed along with Andy Leverenz's light weight Twitter clone let's build video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gUysPm64a4&t=1s&ab_channel=Web-Crunch)

The project helped to cement a number of lessons and readings on authentication within rails and gain a healthy amount of experience using the Devise ruby gem to quickly and securely integrate user authentication into the web app.

Using Devise, the application allows users to sign up and sign in (in addition to signing off and ending the current session), as well as restrict content based on whether a user has successfully signed in.

## Next Steps

Twitter clone could still use a number of improvements including, restricting controls on Tweets to the author of the tweet, adding a follow system, and adding additional controls to tweets (e.g., retweeting or liking).
