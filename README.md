# Sign-up Form Recreation

## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of the Forms and Authentication section of the Ruby on Rails course.

Through this project, followed along with Andy Leverenz's light weight Twitter clone let's build video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gUysPm64a4&t=1s&ab_channel=Web-Crunch)

The project helped to cement a number of lessons and readings on authentication within rails and gain a healthy amount of experience using the Devise ruby gem to quickly and securely integrate user authentication into the web app.

## Next Steps

Twitter clone could still use a number of improvements including, restricting controls on Tweets to the author of the tweet, adding a follow system, and adding additional controls to tweets (e.g., retweeting or liking).
